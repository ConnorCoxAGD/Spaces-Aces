  bio: A little prodigy from far away, Marv has been able to pick up and learn almost
    anything, so long as he's hyper fixated on it at the time. He happens to focus
    on one thing, learn everything he can about, and then stop and never return to
    it again. He's been caught pushing glasses of tables to "see what happens."
