  bio: "Daughter to the famous Frank Skyhardt, she is a prodigy aviator from Earth.
    Entered into the tournament by force, she flies to protect her father, and prove
    herself as an Ace pilot. After passing through the portal during her summoning
    to the arena, spacetime\u2019s grip on Amelie faded, allowing her to occasionally
    phase through the fabric of spacetime and appear seconds later. "
